## Introduction

The aim of this project is to provide a comprehensive analysis of a given dataset through visualization and exploration techniques. Following the analysis, a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model is trained and evaluated by experimenting with different hyperparameters to achieve the best performance.

## Data Visualization

In this section, we used various visualization techniques to understand the distribution and relationships within the data.

- **Heatmap**: Displayed the correlation matrix to understand relationships between features.
- **Pair Plot**: Showed pairwise relationships in the dataset with different classes colored differently.
- **Joint Plot**: Visualized the relationship between two variables along with their distributions.
- **Box Plot**: Illustrated the distribution of individual features and identified outliers.

## Data Exploration and DataFrame Operations

Detailed exploration of the dataset was performed, including:

- Selecting specific columns and rows.
- Handling missing values and outliers.
- Encoding categorical variables using LabelEncoder.
- Conducting descriptive statistics to summarize the dataset.

Example operation:
```python
# Selecting the first five columns
df_5 = df.iloc[:, :5]
KNN Model Evaluation
A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier was evaluated using different hyperparameters to find the optimal model. The performance was assessed on both training and test datasets using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

Parameter Tuning
We used GridSearchCV to search for the best combination of hyperparameters:

n_neighbors
weights
algorithm
leaf_size
metric
Example of GridSearchCV implementation:

python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

param_grid = {
    'n_neighbors': [3, 5, 7],
    'weights': ['uniform', 'distance'],
    'algorithm': ['auto', 'ball_tree', 'kd_tree', 'brute'],
    'leaf_size': [10, 30, 50],
    'metric': ['euclidean', 'manhattan']
}

knn = KNeighborsClassifier()
grid_search = GridSearchCV(knn, param_grid, cv=5, scoring='accuracy', verbose=1, n_jobs=-1)
grid_search.fit(X, y)

print("Best Parameters:", grid_search.best_params_)
print("Best Score:", grid_search.best_score_)
Performance Metrics
Metrics for both training and test datasets were calculated and compared.

Example of metric calculation:

python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, confusion_matrix

train_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_train_true, y_train_pred)
test_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test_true, y_test_pred)
# Other metrics...
Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrates the use of data visualization and exploration techniques to understand a dataset. Additionally, the optimal KNN model configuration was identified through systematic hyperparameter tuning.
